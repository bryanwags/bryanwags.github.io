    <p>Our management team spent some time this week thinking about how we handle 'high conflict situations'. We watched a short online course together where the instructor took us through defining a high conflict behaviour/situation, what to do to challenge and promote change in high conflict people, and how to challenge embedded inappropriate behaviour.</p>
<p>It was time well spent. The conversations were engaged and we came out feeling like we had learned something we could put into practice. It is so important to take time out to think through approaches/issues together - and not just the 'operational' stuff - but the 'culture' stuff too.</p>
<p>Some take-aways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Labelling someone 'difficult', 'dramatic', 'belligerent' etc is just a form of name-calling and isn't appropriate or helpful. We need to focus on the behaviours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all have a responsibility for challenging inappropriate behaviour whenever we see it in the workplace. This will sometimes involve us owning our part in having let it slide in the past. Letting inappropriate, high-conflict behaviour go unchallenged negatively impacts the team, the service and our objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting clear and consistent boundaries, and having well-defined consequences for crossing those boundaries, is critical to dealing with high conflict situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one goes from a '4' to a '10'. But we can go from a '4' to a '5' - ask yourself what you can do to get 'one step' better at something, not what you need to do to be perfect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
