    <p>I took some time out over the holiday to reflect back on what my team had achieved in 2022. I wrote down as many 'big ticket' items as I could think of. I then went bak and wrote a few sentences for each one, outlining what the team had achieved in that area. Soon, I had a document that, while only two pages long, represented a serious contribution that my team had made to our wider service. Looking at the document made me so proud (and a little emotional!). </p>
<p>I plan on sharing the document with my team when we are all back - as a way of reminding them just how much we have achieved together and use it as springboard for discussion on what we want to achieve in 2023. </p>
<p>I also plan to have a 'head/heart' discussion - now we know what we <em>did</em> (head), how did it <em>feel</em> (heart). Thanks to my colleague Fiona for introducing me to this technique. It's important to not only recognise what we did, but also how we did it and how it felt doing it. </p>
<p>This has been and I am sure will be a great exercise in reflective practice. Can't wait to share the outcome of those discussions with my colleagues. </p>
<p>Special thanks to my Deputy Manager Piers Donno-Fuller and my manager Peter Shovlin who make sure that I have time to do such things and encourage me on the journey of reflection, wellbeing and balance.</p>
