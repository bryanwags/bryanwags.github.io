    <p>This week, I based myself on our front desk where any member of the public needing housing assistance can walk in. I took my place on the desk and spoke to customers, dealing with their enquiries as best as I could. Where possible, I let our staff (who do this difficult and challenging role every day) go home early. Me, and my other management colleagues, covered as many of the roles as we could.</p>
<p>We did this because we wanted to show, in a small way, how much we appreciate what our staff do every day. It was a practical way that we could give them something back.</p>
<p>Apart from the obvious benefits of getting off early and not having to cover their usual roles, the unintended benefits were just as important. Our staff had a good laugh watching us try to navigate what, for them, are simple issues. They enjoyed watching us do their roles and seeing that we didn't have all the answers - we got stumped, upset when someone shouted at us etc. We were, human.</p>
<p>We try and do this every year and it always leaves such a good feeling at the end of the year. But this year, something a bit different happened that really took me back.</p>
<p>We share our public access space with a number of other services and teams. We (the homelessness service) aren't exactly a quiet bunch (I think it goes with the role) and so most other people in the reception area got to know what we were up to (especially as they joined in the jokes at our expense!). Yesterday as I was leaving the office that I was stopped in my tracks. I had a number of staff, none of whom I knew, from other services come to me and say how much it had meant to them to see our management team doing what we did.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows just how much you really care about your team&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It made me emotional seeing you there, on the front-line with your staff, taking the brunt of whatever came in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I worked in a team like that.&quot;</p>
<p>Now....our team is by <em>no</em> means perfect, and we have a lot to continue to learn. But....it was so nice to hear from people outside looking in that they saw something special in our leadership style. It was such a wonderful way to end the year.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the impact simple things can have on your team, or those watching. </p>
